# [littleCSS](https://www.littlecss.com)
littleCSS is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any mobile and desktop friendly web project.

Check out <https://www.littlecss.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

For now the best method to get littleCSS is:
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/kevinnading/littleCSS.git`
- Download the zip: <https://github.com/kevinnading/littleCSS/archive/v2.1.0.zip>


### What's in it, you ask?

It includes littleCSS's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
littleCSS/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   └── littlecss.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

littleCSS is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. littleCSS works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
